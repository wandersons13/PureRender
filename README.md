## ⚡ PureRender

**Instant loading by bypassing web bloat.**

PureRender forces websites to display their content immediately by bypassing splash screens, loaders, and artificial delays. It also intercepts heavy telemetry scripts to save bandwidth and speed up your navigation.

### ⚠️ Note:

If a website appears broken or fails to load specific content, use the **"Exclude this site"** option in the script menu. This will whitelist the domain and restore its original behavior
