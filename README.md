## ⚡ PureRender

**Instantly load web pages by preventing web bloat.**

PureRender forces websites to display their content immediately by bypassing splash screens, loaders, and artificial delays. It also intercepts heavy telemetry scripts and tracking requests to save bandwidth and accelerate your navigation.

### 🔌 Official Compatibility with PureYouTube

Since both scripts are part of my performance suite, PureRender is designed to stay out of YouTube's way. Its visual engine is automatically disabled on all YouTube domains to ensure zero conflicts and peak performance.

For the best experience, I highly recommend using **[PureYoutube](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/566055-pureyoutube)** as the dedicated companion for this script. While PureRender optimizes the general web, PureYouTube provides the cinematic and ultra-fast interface I built specifically for YouTube.

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If a website feels "over-optimized" or fails to load specific dynamic content:
1. Click on the script manager icon (Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey).
2. Select **"🚫 Exclude this site"**.
3. The domain will be whitelisted, and its original behavior will be restored instantly.
