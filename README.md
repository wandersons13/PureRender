## ⚡ PureRender

**Instant loading by bypassing web bloat.**

PureRender forces websites to display their content immediately by bypassing splash screens, loaders, and artificial delays. It also intercepts heavy telemetry scripts to save bandwidth and speed up your navigation.

### 🔌 Official Compatibility with PureYoutube

Since both scripts are part of my performance suite, PureRender is designed to stay out of YouTube's way. Its visual engine is automatically disabled on all YouTube domains to ensure zero conflicts and peak performance.

For the best experience, I highly recommend using **[PureYoutube](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/566055-pureyoutube)** as the dedicated companion for this script. While PureRender optimizes the general web, PureYoutube provides the cinematic and ultra-fast interface I built specifically for YouTube.

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If a website appears broken or fails to load specific content, just use the **"🚫 Exclude this site"** option in the script menu. This whitelists the domain and restores its original behavior instantly.
